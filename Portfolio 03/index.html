        <h1>Hi, I'm May Yadanar Thein</h1>
        <p>As an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I am passionate about using technology to empower and uplift communities.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am interning at Go Baby Go, a program dedicated to building adaptive vehicles for children with mobility impairments. There, I apply my creative coding skills to design and implement customized solutions that enhance the children's independence and joy. Previously, I worked as a coding educator at Lat Twae Education, where I taught coding and computational thinking to over 100 students in Myanmar. I also served as a co-officer of the academic department at Thate Pan Hub, a non-profit organization that promotes STEM education and innovation in Myanmar. Through these experiences, I have developed my communication, collaboration, and leadership skills, as well as my ability to adapt to different contexts and challenges.</p>
